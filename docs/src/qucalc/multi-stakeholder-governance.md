## Why blockchain governance matters

Blockchain governance is important because it provides a framework for decision-making and
coordination within a blockchain network. It helps establish rules, protocols, and mechanisms to
ensure the integrity, security, and efficiency of the blockchain system. Here are a few reasons why
blockchain governance is significant:

1. **Decentralization and trust** — Blockchain technology is built on the principles of
   decentralization and trust. Effective governance mechanisms ensure that decision-making power is
   distributed among network participants, reducing reliance on central authorities. This
   decentralized approach enhances transparency, resilience, and trust in the ecosystem.
2. **Consensus and security** — Governance determines the consensus algorithm and the rules for
   validating and confirming transactions. Clear guidelines for validators ensure the security,
   immutability, and integrity of the blockchain, helping prevent fraud, attacks, and unauthorized
   modifications.
3. **Upgrades and evolution** — Governance manages upgrades, improvements, and evolution of the
   protocol. It enables participants to propose and discuss changes, decide on upgrades, and
   implement them through consensus-driven decision-making, so the chain can adapt to new
   technology and needs.
4. **Community engagement and participation** — Governance mechanisms let stakeholders voice
   opinions, suggest improvements, and contribute to the network's development. This inclusive
   approach fosters ownership and commitment among participants.

## Why govern on-chain

There are several reasons why conducting blockchain governance **on-chain** is beneficial:

1. **Transparency** — The entire process is visible to all participants: proposals, voting outcomes,
   and execution are recorded on-chain, so anyone can audit and verify governance activity.
2. **Immutability and tamper-resistance** — Decisions are stored in a decentralized, immutable
   manner. Once recorded they cannot be easily altered or reversed, preserving a strong audit trail
   and the historical record.
3. **Security and robustness** — On-chain governance leverages the resilience of the underlying
   blockchain (consensus + cryptography) against attack and censorship.
4. **Efficiency and automation** — Smart contracts enforce and execute decisions automatically,
   eliminating manual intervention, reducing human error, and ensuring timely execution without
   intermediaries.
5. **Direct participation and token-holder influence** — Token holders exercise voting rights
   directly through on-chain voting, enhancing the democratic nature of governance.
6. **Future-proofing and adaptability** — On-chain governance scales and adapts: new mechanisms can
   be added through protocol upgrades and contract modifications, so the framework evolves with the
   network.

Overall, on-chain governance leverages transparency, immutability, security, and direct
participation to strengthen the integrity, efficiency, and inclusiveness of decision-making.

## The limits of validator-only decision-making

Including *only* validators in decisions has drawbacks:

1. **Centralization concerns** — Concentrating decision power in validators creates centralization
   risk: validators may gain disproportionate control, undermining decentralization and security.
2. **Limited representation** — Excluding users, developers, and token holders limits the diversity
   of perspectives and can reduce the legitimacy of decisions.
3. **Governance capture** — Validators could collude to manipulate decisions in their favor,
   undermining fairness, integrity, and trust.

To address these issues, many governance models strive for broader participation — on-chain voting,
token-based governance, or stakeholder committees — to include a wider range of stakeholders,
mitigate centralization, and enhance legitimacy. This is precisely the *multi-stakeholder* role the
[`rho:gov:*`](architecture.md#native-system-processes) processes fill: weighted, capability-bound
participation rather than validator-only or plutocratic control.

## Process orchestration for multi-stakeholder decision-making

Designing the process orchestration means structuring the steps and activities for effective
participation, collaboration, and decision-making among diverse stakeholders. A general framework:

1. **Preparatory phase**
   a. Identify the purpose and scope of the decision-making process.
   b. Define the key issues, objectives, and desired outcomes.
   c. Identify and engage relevant stakeholders (their diversity and expertise).
   d. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for facilitators, coordinators, and participants.
   e. Develop a communication plan for effective information flow.
2. **Information sharing and capacity building**
   a. Compile and share relevant information, data, and research findings.
   b. Build stakeholders' understanding of the issues and the process.
   c. Provide opportunities to ask questions and explore the subject.
3. **Structured deliberation and collaboration**
   a. Organize facilitated workshops, working groups, or roundtables.
   b. Foster an inclusive, respectful environment for active participation.
   c. Use facilitation techniques for equitable participation and constructive dialogue.
   d. Encourage stakeholders to present positions, concerns, and proposed solutions.
   e. Facilitate brainstorming and exploration of diverse viewpoints and trade-offs.
4. **Consensus building and decision-making**
   a. Identify common ground, shared goals, and areas of agreement.
   b. Facilitate negotiation and dialogue toward consensus.
   c. Consider alternative methods — e.g. voting — when consensus cannot be reached.
   d. Ensure transparency: document decisions, rationale, and any dissents.
5. **Implementation and follow-up**
   a. Develop an action plan for implementing the decisions.
   b. Allocate responsibilities and resources.
   c. Monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes.
   d. Conduct periodic reviews and feedback sessions.
6. **Communication and reporting**
   a. Regularly communicate updates, progress, and decisions to all stakeholders.
   b. Provide opportunities for feedback and continuous improvement.
   c. Prepare reports summarizing the process, outcomes, and next steps.

Throughout, maintain open communication, trust, respect, and inclusivity, with flexibility for
evolving dynamics. The specific orchestration should be tailored to each decision's context and
requirements.

## Stakeholders

The stakeholders of a blockchain infrastructure vary by network and use case. Common ones:

1. **Users** — individuals or entities who transact, use dApps, or access blockchain services.
2. **Developers** — build and maintain the infrastructure: smart contracts, dApps, protocol
   contributions, tools and services; they participate in governance through code and proposals.
3. **Miners/Validators** — process and validate transactions (computational work in PoW, staking in
   PoS) to secure the network and reach consensus.
4. **Token holders** — hold the native tokens and may have voting rights or governance privileges.
5. **Governance entities** — organizations, committees, or entities overseeing governance:
   foundation boards, DAOs, or community-elected committees.
6. **Regulators and governments** — establish legal frameworks, oversight, and guidelines
   (data protection, AML, consumer protection).
7. **Service providers** — wallet providers, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and other value-added
   services built on the infrastructure.

The specific stakeholders and roles vary by network and community.

## Implementation requirements

- **Process orchestration framework** (Rholang + a human facilitator) — the decision phases above,
  encoded as contracts in [`gov.rho`](../../../qucalc/rholang/gov.rho).
- **Sentiment gathering dialog interface** — proposals with pros and cons (à la *ConsiderIt*).
- **Group estimate interface** — estimating impact, and thus voting power, of each stakeholder group
  (the median of individual estimates) — see `Group_Decisions.md` in the
  [upstream references](references.md#decision-support).
- **Object capability security** — possession of a capability *is* authorization; see
  [`quantum-to-rho.md`](quantum-to-rho.md) (§1.1 ZFA as a capability-security model).
- **Liquid democracy** — transitive delegation with cycle/dead-end abstention; see
  [`Governance.md`](../../../qucalc/rholang/Governance.md) and `rho:gov:resolveWeights`.
- **Trust networking** — trust on a trustless network via the admin-rooted, strictly-decreasing
  trust web; see `rho:gov:trustLevels` in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).
- **Enforcement of the formal process model** — the deterministic, order-insensitive folds of
  `qucalc::gov` that every peer reproduces; see the
  [governance decision core](architecture.md#the-governance-decision-core-qucalcgov) in
  [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

## Decision framework

The most widely accepted problem-solving framework is a systematic approach that guides a team
through identifying, analyzing, and solving problems:

1. **Identify the problem** — define and understand it; gather relevant information and data.
2. **Define the goal** — establish specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound (SMART)
   objectives.
3. **Generate potential solutions** — brainstorm a list of possibilities, encouraging creativity
   and diverse perspectives.
4. **Evaluate and analyze solutions** — assess feasibility, effectiveness, and alignment with the
   goal; weigh pros and cons.
5. **Choose the best solution** — select the option with the highest probability of achieving the
   goal.
6. **Implement the solution** — develop an action plan and allocate resources and responsibilities.
7. **Monitor and evaluate** — track progress, collect feedback and data to measure effectiveness.
8. **Iterate and adjust** — if the solution underperforms, revisit the process and modify the
   approach or choose an alternative.
9. **Reflect and learn** — review the process, identify lessons learned, and improve future
   endeavors.

This framework is widely used across disciplines as a structured, logical approach to challenges and
informed decisions. In QuCalc, the *tally* is the decision step (`rho:gov:tally`, weighted IRV or
approval), and the *signed decision of record* is the audit trail (`rho:registry:insertSigned`).

## Implementation tactics

- Manually simulate the process off-chain.
- Capitalize on the liquid-democracy and trust-networking rholang prototype and other
  [EIES3 (RhoGOV)](https://opencollective.com/eies3) work.
- Rnode backend for *ConsiderIt*.
- Add stakeholder-group membership to group members — see `Gov!("member", …)` in
  [`gov.rho`](../../../qucalc/rholang/gov.rho).
- Automate the guided decision-process steps above in the group channel.
- Tally estimates and stakeholder-weighted results — `rho:gov:tally` in
  [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).
- Generic, customizable, user-determined interfaces.
- Evaluate the prototype, refactor, harden, and deploy.

## Footnotes

[a] Decision-making is the most important aspect of blockchain governance.

[b] The tension between on-chain and off-chain governance — especially when quick decision-making is
needed in emergencies — is widely accepted in devising the best governance framework for varied
scenarios.

[c] The role of validators in blockchain governance should always be greater than other stakeholder
types (users / developers / regulators), since validators are responsible for maintaining security in
a PoS network — they support the network by staking. Of course other stakeholders should be involved,
but a balance must be found with the prominence of validators.

[f] It is important to differentiate a **full node** (validates transactions by synchronizing with
the rest of the network, ensuring blockchain-wide consensus) from a **validator node** (validates
transactions according to the blockchain's rules and protocols).
